Arduino Raspberry Pi i2c communication 

The computing power and wireless functionality of the Raspberry Pi coupled with the input/output capability of the Arduino, results in a complete control system to drive any project. If the Raspberry Pi card and the Arduino card are in close proximity, the I2C bus is a good choice of communication protocol. This also makes it possible to add several devices on the same bus and increase the capabilities of the RaspberryPi tenfold.
